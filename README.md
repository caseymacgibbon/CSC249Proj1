This project was a long process. After the first phase, it got confusing for us with multithreading so we went to TA hours, and the Phuong was very helpful and showed us the executor which helped us to run multiple lines of code at once. Kaia and I watched a very introductory video on what threading is and how it works while taking notes on the video, trying to figure out what we were trying to accomplish. Threading allows us to have multiple requests on one server. We made a function and called it in the main also using the executor. I learned a lot about threading and running multiple lines of code, why this is useful, and how this can help our server be more useful. 
In phase 3, we had written client.py in its entirety but were getting a Null Pointer Exception. Sabrina and I went to TA hours again, and found a syntax error, and we also needed to convert the port number to an integer. We were also missing a space, and this helped our client.py file to run.
